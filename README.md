# Python Django Dev To Deployment
This repo is just for learning purpose, it is a clone from [bradtraversy/btre_project](https://github.com/bradtraversy/btre_project). I also followed along with his course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-django-dev-to-deployment/). The course guides on building a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) application with [Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-django-dev-to-deployment/).

It is a project-based course where he will explain and build the application while introducing Django concepts bit by bit.

For more information, check out his [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-django-dev-to-deployment/).
